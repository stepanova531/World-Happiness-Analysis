# World-Happiness-Analysis
Data analysis of the factors that contribute the most to the happiness level
# Objective
To explore the trends in happiness and which factors contribute the most to the happiness level.
# Scenario
Many people would like to move to another country for a long term without establishing permanent residency there. Among their objectives, there are traveling, working, studying, and temporary stay in a country with comfortable climate, but all of them give their preference to a country where the living conditions will contribute to their happiness. 
There are two main categories: retired people, whose main criteria are safety, good social relationships and access to high quality medical services. Another group is young people and their demands are good salary, low costs of living and freedom of choice.

# Insights and Recommendations
  For the retired people aiming at temporarily staying in different countries, the relationship between happiness score and life expectancy and social support has been analyzed. 
- Both factors have positive and strong correlation with the happiness score. 
- Nations with the highest life expectancy score are not classified as the happiest counties. While family and social support contribute a lot to the people’s happiness in the counties from the top-20 list. 
- I would suggest that elderly people select a country of their destination from the top happiest counties and with a high social relationship level. 
  For the younger generation, whose purposes in life are traveling & working, I have analyzed how GDP per capita and freedom are correlated with the happiness score. 
- GDP per capita has the strongest correlation. Freedom has weaker, but still positive correlation.   
- The highest level of GDP isn’t always compatible with the high happiness level. Moreover, five countries out of ten that reported the highest GDP score are ruled by autocratic governments. It is very unlikely that young people will be happy to stay there for a long term.          
- I would recommend that young people select a country of their destination from the top happiest counties and with a high freedom level.
